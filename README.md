## Introduction:
  "Campus life is that part of your life that you will relive in your memories till you breathe." <br/>
And we are here to make it more accessible as hostelers suffer from a chronic disease: deficiency of cash. Although UPI services provide relief, we still found servers are down most of the time. Smart Campus creates a wallet for a student per semester (from other advances at the time of registration). He can pay through that wallet to any canteen or stationery shop inside the Campus without worrying about cash and bad servers. Hostel plays an essential role in students' studies, and thus hostel management is crucial. From common Water Cooler Complaints to Ambulance Calling, Daily Night Entries to Leave Applications, everything runs at a slower pace. Smart Campus provides the best solution to accelerate and automate the Hostel Management.
